Encrypted DNS Survey: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3547331

The survey mentions these two papers, which are exactly what we're trying to do just not with DNS over QUIC:
1) An investigation on information leakage of DNS over TLS: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359989.3365429
2) Encrypted DNS -> Privacy? A Traffic Analysis Perspective: https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/encrypted-dns-privacy-a-traffic-analysis-perspective/

The second paper includes the code they used to collect / analyze traffic: https://github.com/spring-epfl/doh_traffic_analysis
Here is the folder with code for collecting data: https://github.com/spring-epfl/doh_traffic_analysis/tree/master/code/collection

DNS Proxy from adguard: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy

Other random stuff:

Overview of current state of DNS over QUIC: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-030-98785-5_24
    full paper: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-98785-5_24
    paper slides: https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/113/materials/slides-113-maprg-one-to-rule-them-all-a-first-look-at-dns-over-quic
    ^ That paper is useful for us because it basically says that DNS over QUIC is already superior to DoT and DoH,
    which means that it will hopefully soon overtake the others as the dominant form of encrypted DNS, thus motivating our study.
