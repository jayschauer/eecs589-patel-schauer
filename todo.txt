Questions for DNS capture:
1) Initial test_capture.pcapng with dnsproxy showed a periodic packet/response of length 67 on port 853 to adguard server that wasn't from a dns query.
What were those? Bootstrap messages? Don't want them to messup the data collection.
2) Are we actually capturing what we need to be capturing?
I.e. Aakash saw some other stuff in wireshark when he was looking at DNS over Quic that didn't show up in dnsproxy tcpdump.
3) If we can compare the tcpdump/wireshark of dnsproxy when browsing with some other dnsover quic method,
that would help reassure we are capturing correctly.

Questions for headless browsing:
1) Does selenium actually cache anything (including javascript or whatever)
2) Can we just use a regular headless browser (will be much faster than selenium)

Once we settle those questions:
1) Obtain list of domains we want to capture dns queries to.
2) Update collection script as needed
3) Run this on the class server.
